# Terrain-Recognition-Using-Transfer-Learning
   Implemented a terrain classification system by fine-tuning pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), including VGG16 and ResNet50, on large-scale image datasets. The project involved extensive data preprocessing, model optimization and achieved high accuracy in recognizing various terrain types.
